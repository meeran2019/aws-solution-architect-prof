VPC PEERING: 
    Used to connect one VPC to another. Or from one central VPC to multiple VPC.
    Instances in both vpc communicate with each other as they are in same network.
    Can create VPC peering in same account or different account or different region.


CROSS ACCOUNT ACCESS: 
    Resource based policy specifies who can access resurces.
    

CLOUDFRONT ENCRYPTION:
    Field level encryption adds additional layer of security along with HTTPS that protects specific data throughout processing. It is encrypted in edge location and only descrypted by application.
    Signed URL is used to distribute private content.
    Cant use self signed certificate between cloudfront and origin.
    In cloudfront, have default SSL certificates not in ELB.

    HTTPS between user and cloudfront,
        Can use certificate issued by trusted CA which import into ACM or AWS IAM.
        Can use certificate provided by ACM.

    HTTPS between cloudfront and origin,
        If origin is ELB, can use ACM.
        If origin is not ELB like EC2, must use trusted CA.

    If cloudfront custom domain, then cannot use default certificate. For default domain, can use default certificate.


DIRECT CONNECT:
    It is connecting onprem to AWS by acheive higher privacy benefits, additional data transfer bandwidth and more predictable data transfer performance. 
    Consistent network experience than internet based connections.
    Network device that support BGP and BGP MD5 authentication is needed in onprem to establish connection.


KINESIS:
    When kinesis data stream is configured as source for kinesis firehose, firehose putrecord & putrecordbatch operations are disabled by default and kinesis agent cannot write directly to firehose.
    Kinesis agent is stand alone java software application that offers easy way to collect and send data to kinesis data stream or data firehose. 


AWS SSO (IDENTITY CENTRE):
    Simple AD is not supported. 


SSM STATE MANAGER:
    It is secure and scalable configuration management service that automates the process of keeping EC2 and hybrid infrastructure in specific state,
        Bootstrap instances with specific software.
        Download and upload agents like ssm agent.
        Configure network settings.
        Join instances to windows domain.
        Patch instances with software updates.
        Run scripts on linux and windows managed instances.

AWS REKOGNITION:
    Read text from images.


EC2:
    Migrate instance to another region with same key pair: 
        1. Create instances.
        2. Under instance -> Actions -> Image & templates -> Create image.
        3. Under images -> AMI -> Copy AMI -> Select different region.
        4. In destination region, under Key pair -> Actions -> Import key.
        5. NOTE: Dont use .pem file. It contains private key, use key-gen tool to generate public key from .pem file.
        6. Once imported, it available in another region.

    Key-pair is region specific. In KMS, can generate single or multi region key.


AWS DIRECT CONNECT:
    Can connect direct connect with VPC.
    It consists of aws cage (direct connect endpoints) and customer cage (router)
    Onprem -> Customer cage (customer gateway) -> Direct connect endoint -> VGW or Direct connect gateway.
    VGW is connected to single vpc in one region.
    Direct connect gateway is global and connect to multiple VGW in different regions.
    Public Interface,, Private Interface, Transit Interface. 
    Link Aggregation group (LACP protocol).
    Transt interface is used to include transit gateway to multiple vpc.
    To connect to AWS public services use Public virtual Interface. 
    To connect to S3, use public vitural interface not private virtual interface.


SITE TO SITE VPN CONNECTION:
    Use non overlaping cidr blocks.
    IPV6 traffic is not supported in virtual private gateway.
    It doesnot support path MTU discovery.

    It utilizes the Ipsec tunnel encryption vis direct connect.
    In customer side, customer gateway.
    In aws side, connect to VGW.

VPC ENDPOINT:
    It helps to connect from private subnet to AWS services without going through internet.

RDS: 
    RDS doesnot support RMAN (Recovery Manager) backup utility.
    Amazon RDS doesnot support oracle feature like Multitenent database, Real Application CLuster, Unified Auditing, Database Vault etc.


STORAGE GATEWAY:
    In volume gateway, volume is stored in s3 as snapshot. To restore, require EBS volume or volume storage gateway. Support POSIX complaint. 
    Cache Volume - Support upto 1024 TB. 
    Storage volume - Support upto 512 TB.
    Storage gateway uses "Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol"(CHAP) to authenticate ISCSI and initiator connections. It provides protection agaings playback attacks. 

S3:
    Amazon S3 is not a POSIX complaint.


BYOIP (Bring Your Own IP):
    It helps to maintain same onprem IP while moving to Cloud.

ROUTE 53:
    Bad actor spoof site and use their own ip address is called man in middle attack. 
    It support DNSSEC for domain registration and DNS Service.
    Generally s3 owner pays for the storage and data transfer cost. If enabled "Requester pays", requester will pay for request and data transfer cost. Also require requester to pass x-amz-requester-pay in header or pass parameter in CLI.
    Health check is available for non alias records. For alias records, no health check.
    For alias records, specify Evaluate target health to Yes. 
    For non alias records, use health check.


RDS:
    In multi AZ, cannot access standby instance.


LAMBDA + VPC:
    Lambda create ENI that allow lambda to access VPC resources.


OPSWORKS:
    Autohealing is set at layer level which can be enabled. It helps to automatically replace instance failed instances.


AWS VM IMPORT/EXPORT vs SMS:
    Import/Export helps to move images from AWS from/to onprem. It doesnot do incremenetal images.
    SMS does incremental updates.


CERTIFICATE MANAGER (ACM):
    It is region specific. 
    For ELB, create certificate with same fqdn in each region or account. 
    For cloudfront, create certificate in us-east-1.

    Schema changes to complex to decouple from code change.
    Application need deployment aware
    Not blue green deployment friendly.

IDENTITY BROKER:
    If saml2 is not supported, then to use custom identity broker.
    Identity broker interact with STS with AssumeRole or GetFederationTokens to obtain security credentials.

AWS CONFIG:

    Depends upon instance type, no of ENI can attach is varies.

EBS Volume:
    For encryption at rest, it supports
        Encrypt data before storing on EBS
        Use 3rd part volume encryption software.
        Use native data encryption drivers.

LAMBDA:
    Lambda function cannot connect directly to VPC with dedicated instance tenancy.
    For lambda to connect to VPC, require sufficient ENI.

RESERVED INSTANCE:
    If reserved instances bought in specific AZ. Only other accounts can share the reserve instance in that particular AZ.

Appsych is recommended for GraphQL APIs not REST APIs

Cloud HSM, For account manager to login use SSH.

=> Web ACL add at ALB, Custom header at Cloudfront. 

Application cannot resolve record sets created in private hosted zone of another aws account. Solution is Associate private hosted zone with vpc in another account. It requires, 
        1. Authorize the association in Route53 in account A to VPC in account B.
        2. From account B, create the association.

Legacy application inside VPC with hard coded IP address, to failover:
    Create a secondary ENI
    Assign secondary private IP address to primary ENI
