YAML 101: 

    It is human readable data serialization language based on key: value pair.
    Based on intendation.


JSON 101: 

    Java Script Object Notation.
    It is light weight interchange format. 
    It is easy for humans and machine to read and parse. 

    values can be another object, string or list. 

    { "key1": "value1", "key2": value2 }

    ["value1", "value2", "value3"]

    { "key1": ["value1", "value2", "value3"]}

    {               -   top level objects

    }


NETWORKING: 

    Local Networking - Ethernet -   data moves between devices.
    Routing -   how data moves in internet. 
    Segmenting, Ports & Sessions
    Application Layer 

OSI 7 LAYER MODEL: 

    It is conceptual and called networking stack. 

    Host Layers:
        Layer 7     Application     
        Layer 6     Presentation    
        Layer 5     Session         
        Layer 4     Transport       

    Media Layers: 
        Layer 3     Network         
        Layer 2     Data link       
        Layer 1     Physical        

LAYER1 - PHYSICAL: 

    Layer1 device understand Layer1 device. Layer3 device understand Layer1,2. 

    It is point to point communication between 2 network interface devices or just do broadcast if using hub. 

    HUB - If requires more than 2 devices, it connects through hub. 

    It is like broadcasting and send to all ports and all devices. 

    If multiple devices transmit then collision occurs. 

    
LAYER2 - DATA LINK: 

    It provides device to device communication. 

    MAC - Media Access Control 

    MAC - Unique Hardware Address with hexadecimal value and unique for device.

    Collision is reduced by using carrier signal. 

    Hub is Layer1. Switch is Layer2. Switch understand Layer2 and send directly to dedicated destination.

    same network only can be connected. For example, ethernet network connection between themselves or wifi connection themselves. 

DECIMAL TO BINARY CONVERSION: 

    in IP address 10.12.14.15 -> binary format. 

    Ranges from 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255

    https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html


LAYER3 - NETWORK: 

    Layer2 doesnot support multiple network connection. It has source and destination address. 

    Internet Protocol is layer3 protocol which adds IP address and routing to move data between networks.

    It contains packets of data.

    It contains V4 & v6 IP protocal.

    IP V4 ADDRESS: 

        10.12.13.14         -   dotted decimal notation

        It consists of Network part and Host part. Network part which network it belongs and Host part tells which host machine. 

        10      -   first octet 
        12      -   second octet 

        each with 8 bits and total 32 bits. 

        10.12.13.14/16      -   16 represent the network part. 

    SUBNET MASKS: 

        It represent which part of IP address is Network part. 
        10.12.13.14/16      -   it means first and second octet are host part. 

        It helps to determine whether to communicate local or remote. 

        00000000    -   0
        11111111    -   255 

    ROUTER: 

        Packets move from source to destination in multiple hops. 
        Router/route table used to check the destination and next hob/target is selected.

        0.0.0.0/24      -   it represents all destination packets. 

        Destination     Next Hob/Target 
        10.12.13.1/24   10.12.13.5

    ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL: 

        It gives the MAC address for the given IP address. 
        In layer2, ARP used to get the MAC address for the IP address. 

    LIMIATATION: 
        No method for channel of communication like mobile, web etc.
        packets can send in any order.
        packets can miss

LAYER4 - TRANSPORT: 

    TCP     -   slow and reliable, connection oriented protocal.
    UDP     -   fast and less reliable. 

    It consists of segments which placed inside packets.
    It introduces port.
    sequence numbers used to ensure correct order nbrs for packets.

    TCP: (Transmission Control Protocal)

        It is connection based protocal.
        A connection is established between two devices using random port on client and known port on server. 
        Once connection is established, it is bidirectional. 

        3 way handshake : 
            SYN
            SYN-ACK
            ACK 

        Ephermal Port: Dynamic in nature 
        Well known port: 443, 80 

    SESSION STATE: 

        Stateless Firewall: 
            It requires outbund and inbound rule. 
            NACL is stateless.
            It is bidirectional and send request and receive response separately. 

        Stateful Firewall: 
            It sees both request and response as single thing. 
            If inbound is allowed default allows outbound. 

        
    NAT (Network Address Translation): 

        NAT is designed to overcome public IPv4 shortages and allows private device to connect to internet. 

        10.0.0.0    -   This is private IP range and cant be use in internet.

        Static NAT  -   1 private IP address to 1 static public IP address (internet gateway)
        Dynamic NAT -   1 private IP address to multiple pool of public IP address.

        Port Address Translation - Many Private to 1 public  (Nat gateway). It uses port to differentiate.

        NAT is used to transform/connect from private IP to public IP. It using NAT table which maps private IP and public IP.

    IP ADDRESSING AND SUBNETTING: 

        0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 

        Private address can be used/reused freely.

        Class A -> 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 - Large business and regional regions - /16

        Class B -> 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 - Large business and regional regions - /16

        Class C -> 192.0.0.0 - 233.255.255.255 -  /24 - Smaller business.

        Class D -> Multicast 
        Class E -> Reserved.

        Private Networks: 

            10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255      -   class A. used in cloud networks etc.
            172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255    -   class B
            192.168.0.0 to 196.168.255.255  -   class C. Used in home generally.

    SUBNETTING: 

        CIDR - Classless Inter Domain Routing.

        10.0.0.0/16     -   /16 is prefix 
        larget the prefix, smaller is network available.

        https://www.subnet-calculator.com/subnet.php?net_class=A

        0.0.0.0     -   It matches the entire internet, so it is default for internet.

        /32         -   represent single IP address.

        Subnetting is process of taking larger network and break down into smaller network. 
        Larger the prefix, it is small in network.

    
    DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service): 
mmm,,mn
        Types: 
            In Application layer - HTTP Get request.
            In Transport Layer - SYN request.
            In DNS Server - Multiple request sent to DNS server and redirects to our server.

    SSL & TLS: 

        Secure Sockets Layer 
        Transport Layer Securityf

         It provides privacy and data integrity between client and server.
         Communications are encrypted.

         It consists of symmetric and asymmetric.

         Symmetric: based on key. Same key is used by both client and server.
         Asymmetric: Based on public and private key.

    VLANS , TRUNKS & QinQ: 

    JUMBO FRAMES AND MTU: 

        In ethernet standard frame, 1500 bytes. Bigger than this is jumbo frame.

        Doesnot support jumbo frame:
            Traffic outside of VPC 
            Traffic over inter region VPC peering connection.
            Traffic over VPN connection.
            Traffic over internet gateway.

        Support jumbo frame,
            Same region VPC peering.
            Direct Connect 
            Transit gateway 

    ENCRYPTION 101: 

        Symmetric & Asymmetric 

        Encryption at rest & encryption in transit 

        
DNS: 

    Domain Name System

    Generally use to convert domain name to IP address.

    Client      -   Requires information for the domain. It is piece of software install on mobile, computer etc. 
    Resolver    -   It helps to query the DNS server. It can be on same machine or in separate server.
    Nameserver  -   where zone files are hosted.
    Zone        -   amazon.com  is a zone which contains www=>ip-address
    zonefile    -   physical database for zone.
